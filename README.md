## Project Overview
TaxiCab's CEO, Henry Bentley, lacks complete visibility into how well the company is performing and is seeking insights to identify growth opportunities. This project aims to address the following key concerns:

* Average Tip Analysis: Determine the average tip received by a vendor during the day.
* Busiest Time of Day: Identify which time of the day is the busiest for taxi trips.
* Data Cleaning: Clean the data to fix any anomalies and prepare it for analysis.
* Payment Type Classification: Classify trips based on the actual payment type using a metadata table for reference.
* Congestion Surcharge Analysis: Explore any relationship between congestion surcharge and trip distance.
Additionally, the project seeks to provide extra insights beyond the initial problem statement to help TaxiCab enhance its operations.

## Key Features
1. Data Handling:
* Working with raw data in both CSV and JSON formats.
* Cleaning and preparing the data for analysis.
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):
* Analyzing key aspects such as average tips, busiest times of day, and relationships between various factors like congestion surcharge and trip distance.
3. Final Dataset Preparation:
* Cleaning and organizing the data into a final dataset suitable for visualization.
4. Visualization in Tableau:
* Using Tableau to create dashboards that provide clear, actionable insights for TaxiCab's internal team.
